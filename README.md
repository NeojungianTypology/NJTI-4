# `NJTI-4`

A open interdisciplinary typology of individual differences in personality.

`NJTI-4` stands for `Neojungian Type Indicator 4`, which is a personality-type categorization based on four latent factors.

Currently we have proven the validity of this construct in two cultures: English and Swedish and both sets of questions are available in this repository.
