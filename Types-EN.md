### EJ - Executives

Executives have a preference towards action, presence, and short-term, hands on experience. Executives drive things forward with their dominant world-view, preferring to intervene directly. They thrive when they can engage topics and problems from a set interest or perspective, and generally prefer to make decisions in the situation instead of corresponding with universal laws and procedures. Executives enjoy to monitor and to be aware of their environment and the people in it. They have fun in controlled environments and clashes of opinions, or fists. They naturally prefer action-filled environments, where there is always something to engage them. They prefer to directly respond to interruptions and to engage conflicts directly.
Executives prefer to focus their attention towards things of their interest, controlling the flow of information related to their world-view, taking on a form of soccer approach to life. They are at their best when they are fully updated on the present situation and when they can respond to any new updates based on instinct. Spending time calculating or anticipating events can break their flow.
Executives require more direct control than Explorers, and respond worse to environments which lack supervision and predetermined standards of procedure, and such situations can make them more distanced and detached. Executives require more action than Leaders, and can become affective and emotional in situations that are unable to keep them engaged.

### IJ - Leaders

Leaders have a preference towards caution, distance, and long-term, big-picture thinking. Leaders lead with their dominant world-view, preferring not to intervene directly. They thrive when they can engage topics and problems with a set interest or perspective, and become uncertain if they can’t think of how to approach a topic. This makes them ideal leaders: they enjoy to be in the position of supervising a system or a group from a distance, but can become affective or detached if this mode is disrupted. They naturally prefer to direct: movies, stories, projects, people, research, or applications, but are also common in areas that require long-term devotion and focus.
They prefer to focus their attention towards things of their interest, controlling the flow of information and how things proceed, with a form of chess-board mentality. They are at their best, when they have thought several steps in advance, and become stressed when they are unable to execute these steps properly. Unanticipated events can get them out of their flow.
Leaders are more self-directed than Executives, and respond worse to supervision and outside control, becoming more affective. In these situations, they can become more choleric and aggressive. Leaders are more productive than Advisors, and feel a stronger desire to intervene and control the situation. If unable to intervene, they become more detached and disengaged, feeling a need to withdraw and pull back.

### EP - Explorers

Explorers enjoy action, presence, and fast-changing environments.  Explorers lead with curiosity, enjoying to continuously scan and review their present situation. Explorers primarily scan for things related to their dominant world-view and enjoy being the first to try out new things. They thrive when they can engage a situation or problem instinctively rather than based on a strict plan. They generally prefer to make decisions in the moment rather than from a distance and have more fun in relaxed, informal environments.
It’s natural for them to directly respond to new situations and relate to life through a form of dancers mentality, moving and adapting to the music or the mood of the situation. At their best, they move from situation to situation in a free-flow manner, adapting as they go.
Arguments or clashes of opinions or perspectives, experiencing control from others, can make them affective and emotional, making them become aggressive. In situations where there isn't enough new things which capture their interest, they can become detached and depressed.

### IP - Advisors

Advisors enjoy distance, caution, and reflection in adaptive, free-flow environments. They lead with silent curiosity, enjoying to meticulously study a topic or interests various details or viewpoints. They prefer not to intervene in things directly, instead offering advice or running trials from a distance. This makes them ideal teachers or analysts: they enjoy the position of answering questions and informing people on a topic, but prefer to do so in a less direct and controlled manner than the leaders. They have the most fun in relaxed, informal settings, with little pressure, and a lot of free-flow brainstorming.
They prefer to analyze conditions and possibilities, and tend to have more of a line-dancers mentality, often juggling and revising their positions on various issues and problems, offering the most in-depth, thorough and careful decision makers. In optimal environments they are given ample time for reflection and brainstorming in collaboration with others.
